    //✅ 1. What is a Database?
    //A database is a place where you store and manage data in an organized way so that it can be easily retrieved,
    // updated, and deleted when needed.
    //
    //Key Points:
    //Think of it like an Excel sheet, but much more powerful.
    //
    //Used in websites, apps, banking, social media — everywhere data is involved.

    //✅ 2. Types of Databases
    //Databases can be of two major types:
    //
    //1. Relational Databases (SQL):
    //Data is stored in tables (rows & columns).
    //
    //Follows strict rules with schema (structure).
    //
    //Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to query data.
    //
    //Examples:
    //
    //PostgreSQL ✅ (what you’re using)
    //
    //MySQL
    //
    //Oracle
    //
    //SQL Server
    //
    //2. Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):
    //Data is stored in JSON, key-value, documents, or graphs.
    //
    //More flexible, used in large-scale modern applications.
    //
    //Examples:
    //
    //MongoDB
    //
    //Cassandra
    //
    //Redis
    //
    //✅ 3. Why Use PostgreSQL?
    //PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source, relational database. It is known for:
    //
    //✅ High security
    //
    //✅ Support for advanced queries and large datasets
    //
    //✅ Reliability and ACID compliance
    //
    //✅ Built-in features like full-text search, JSON support, etc.
    //
    //✅ Great support with Spring Boot and ORMs like JPA/Hibernate
